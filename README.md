# Skjutsgruppen challenge @ Greenhackathon Stockholm
This is a prototype developed during the Smart Cities Green Hackathon (http://smartcities.greenhackathon.com) for the Skjutsgruppen challenge (http://smartcities.greenhackathon.com/challenge-skjutsgruppen).

The prototype contains(mock) base functionality for searching for/offering rides and it also showcases some of our feature ideas (gamification, statistics, interactive map).
