# Skjutsgruppen challenge @ Greenhackathon Stockholm
This is a prototype developed during the Smart Cities Green Hackathon (http://smartcities.greenhackathon.com) for the Skjutsgruppen challenge (http://smartcities.greenhackathon.com/challenge-skjutsgruppen).

The prototype contains(mock) base functionality for searching for/offering rides and it also showcases some of our feature ideas (gamification, statistics, interactive map).

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

We probably lost track of all prerequisites (let the error messages guide you ;)) but a few of them are

- git, added to your command line PATH
- node.js (v3.2.3 ish)
- ionic (1.7.14)
- gulp
- a web browser ;)

## Running

- Go to project directory
- Run npm install
- Run bower install
- Run ionic serve. TADA!
